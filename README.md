# Runge-Kutta 4th Order Simulation Hub ðŸš€

This repository provides an interactive simulation tool built using **Streamlit** that uses the **Runge-Kutta 4th order** method to solve and visualize the solutions of various ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It covers different types of dynamic systems, such as predator-prey models, chaotic attractors, damped oscillators, and rocket launches.

## Streamlit App

You can run the app directly on Streamlit by following this link:  
[Runge-Kutta 4th Order Simulation Hub](https://runge-kutta-order-4-xy6kmxwfmkhvum5wpwwjtr.streamlit.app/)

## Overview

The **Runge-Kutta 4th Order** method is a numerical technique for solving ODEs. This project allows you to select from different models, adjust parameters, and see the simulations and visualizations.

### Available Models:
- **Particle Shot Simulation**: Simulate the trajectory of a particle under gravity and air resistance.
- **Rocket Launch Simulation (1D)**: Simulate a vertical rocket launch considering gravitational acceleration and changing rocket mass.
- **Lotka-Volterra (Predator-Prey) Model**: Simulate the dynamics of predator and prey populations.
- **Lorenz Attractor**: Visualize the chaotic behavior of a three-dimensional system.
- **Van der Pol Oscillator**: Simulate a non-conservative oscillator with nonlinear damping.
- **Damped Harmonic Oscillator**: Simulate a harmonic oscillator with damping.

### Key Features:
- Interactive dashboard with sliders for adjusting parameters.
- Real-time simulation and visualization of dynamic systems.
- Plotting of solutions, including phase portraits, time-series, and 3D visualizations.
- Downloadable raw data for further analysis.
